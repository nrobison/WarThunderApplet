# WarThunderApplet
Small War Thunder Applet for the G19 Keyboard using C#

Credit goes to [Dan Minut](http://www.mangareader.com/dmclglcd.html) for providing a great example.

For the needed  C++ dll files see [Logitech G Developers Lab](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/developers) and download Game Panel SDK.
Decent documentation is available in PDF format from Logtiech in the download. See above for a better example if you want to get started on your own.
